> how to use prompt to guide model to extinct understand the status, and when model see some specifc words or phases can do the status changing?

To guide a language model to understand and change status based on specific words or phrases, you can design prompts that include instructions for the model to follow. You can also establish a set of keywords or phrases that trigger a certain status change. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. **Define the Statuses:** Clearly define the different statuses that you want the model to recognize and switch between.

2. **Create Trigger Words/Phrases:** Decide on specific words or phrases that will act as triggers for each status change.

3. **Design the Prompt:** Write a prompt that includes the instructions for the model, explaining how it should react to the trigger words or phrases.

4. **Incorporate Contextual Clues:** If needed, provide additional context within the prompt that can help the model understand when a status change is appropriate.

5. **Test and Refine:** After setting up your initial system, test the model with various inputs to ensure it reacts correctly to the trigger words or phrases. Refine your prompts and triggers as needed.



**Here's an example to illustrate this process:**

- **Statuses:** Normal conversation (Status A), Technical support (Status B), and End conversation (Status C).
- **Trigger Words/Phrases:** "technical issue" (for Status B), "goodbye" (for Status C).
- **Prompt:** "You are an AI trained to conduct normal conversations. However, when someone mentions a 'technical issue,' you should switch to technical support mode. If someone says 'goodbye,' you should understand that the conversation is ending."



**Now, let's see this in action with a sample dialogue:**

- **User:** Hi there, I'm having a bit of trouble with my phone.
- **AI (Status A):** Hello! I'd be happy to chat with you. What seems to be the problem with your phone?
- **User:** It's a technical issue; the screen keeps flickering.
- **AI (Status B):** I understand you're experiencing a technical issue. Let's switch to technical support mode. Have you tried restarting your phone to see if that resolves the screen flickering?

The model recognizes "technical issue" as a trigger to switch to Status B, which is the technical support mode. The conversation continues in this status until the user says "goodbye," which would trigger the model to switch to Status C and end the conversation.

Remember that while models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 are quite sophisticated in understanding context and following instructions, they are not perfect and can sometimes misunderstand or fail to act on the prompts as intended. Regular testing and refining of the prompts and triggers are important to improve the interaction flow.
