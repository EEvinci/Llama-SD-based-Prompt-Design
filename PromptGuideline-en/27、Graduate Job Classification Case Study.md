# Graduate Job Classification Case Study

[Clavi√© et al., 2023(opens in a new tab)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07142) provide a case-study on prompt-engineering applied to a medium-scale text classification use-case in a production system. Using the task of classifying whether a job is a true "entry-level job", suitable for a recent graduate, or not, they evaluated a series of prompt engineering techniques and report their results using GPT-3.5 (`gpt-3.5-turbo`).

The work shows that LLMs outperforms all other models tested, including an extremely strong baseline in DeBERTa-V3. `gpt-3.5-turbo` also noticeably outperforms older GPT3 variants in all key metrics, but requires additional output parsing as its ability to stick to a template appears to be worse than the other variants.

The key findings of their prompt engineering approach are:

- For tasks such as this one, where no expert knowledge is required, Few-shot CoT prompting performed worse than Zero-shot prompting in all experiments.
- The impact of the prompt on eliciting the correct reasoning is massive. Simply asking the model to classify a given job results in an F1 score of 65.6, whereas the post-prompt engineering model achieves an F1 score of 91.7.
- Attempting to force the model to stick to a template lowers performance in all cases (this behaviour disappears in early testing with GPT-4, which are posterior to the paper).
- Many small modifications have an outsized impact on performance.
  - The tables below show the full modifications tested.
  - Properly giving instructions and repeating the key points appears to be the biggest performance driver.
  - Something as simple as giving the model a (human) name and referring to it as such increased F1 score by 0.6pts.

### Prompt Modifications Tested

| Short name | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Baseline   | Provide a a job posting and asking if it is fit for a graduate. |
| CoT        | Give a few examples of accurate classification before querying. |
| Zero-CoT   | Ask the model to reason step-by-step before providing its answer. |
| rawinst    | Give instructions about its role and the task by adding to the user msg. |
| sysinst    | Give instructions about its role and the task as a system msg. |
| bothinst   | Split instructions with role as a system msg and task as a user msg. |
| mock       | Give task instructions by mocking a discussion where it acknowledges them. |
| reit       | Reinforce key elements in the instructions by repeating them. |
| strict     | Ask the model to answer by strictly following a given template. |
| loose      | Ask for just the final answer to be given following a given template. |
| right      | Asking the model to reach the right conclusion.              |

Template stickiness refers to how frequently the model answers in the desired format.
